# Executive Summary

The Smart Animal Feeder is a comprehensive solution that caters to the diverse needs of pets in a household. It brings convenience, efficiency, and peace of mind to pet owners, ensuring that feeding time becomes a harmonious and stress-free experience.

The Smart Animal Feeder offers a personalized feeding schedule, allowing users to dispense precise portions of food to prevent overeating or disruptions in feeding routines. This is particularly useful for households with pets that have unique dietary needs, including those requiring special veterinary-prescribed foods or having allergy considerations.

Designed to bring harmony to multi-pet environments, this feeder incorporates an intelligent system that dispenses food exclusively to the designated pet wearing an RF chip on its collar. This feature not only prevents feeding chaos but also ensures that each pet receives the appropriate nutrition without interference from others.

Equipped with a spacious hopper, the feeder can store and maintain the freshness of a week's worth of food. The automatic dispensing mechanism, powered by a motor, eliminates the need for manual feeding, providing a hassle-free and consistent experience for both pets and their owners.

The RF chip on the animal's collar serves as a secure identifier, allowing only the specified pet access to the feeding bowl. In the absence of the chip, the feeder seals the tray, preventing unauthorized access and promoting the security of the feeding process.
